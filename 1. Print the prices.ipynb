    "# Theory\n",
    "Welcome to your first Python project! On Hyperskill, a project is a practical task where you apply skills from theoretical topics. Each project is a complete application: a game, a search engine, etc. To help you grasp the idea, let's write a simple net income calculator in this one!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first stage in the project, a step in its development. For example, you can't create a Tetris game in one take; instead, break down the task into smaller steps â€” designing a game board or a menu. Same with our projects, each consists of multiple stages.\n",

    "Below, you will find a description that gives a context behind what you should do. Objectives state the main task of the stage and the details.\n",
